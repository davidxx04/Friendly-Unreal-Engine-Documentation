Installing vs 2022 and then Rider to make the game run with c++ is the worst s*** I have ever done in my life, a lot of weird problems with things like sdk, visual building tools, version problems because it was not 7.8 so it ruined my existence and so on.
Definetily I learn something increibidly important that is follow the documentation about how to install vs2022 with all complements needed and make sure it works correctly before starts, and moreover before trying to use rider because not only it is not going to work, but also you will want to k*** yourself during the process.


## IMPORTANT principles
Everything that you create in c++ is only visible in c++ until you expose it (macros do that job)

## [[Friendly Unreal Engine Documentation/logic programming/c++/Macros|Macros]]
Well, I have learned a concept called macros, which are the unreal engine labels for itÂ´s own data types, elements... For example UPROPERTY is the label used to create a variable visible in the editor. Or FTransform is the name that the data type for the location, rotation and scale, receives.
