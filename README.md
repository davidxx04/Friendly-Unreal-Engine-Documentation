## Friendly Unreal Engine Documentation

This repository is a personal knowledge base organized around practical UE5 topics: blueprints, C++, world-building, inputs, version control and more. It’s optimized for human readers (and Obsidian lovers), not a packaged binary or plugin.

#### Important
Consider that it will contain errors frequently because it´s a personal Documentation made during my learning process, and published to show what I have been learning and writing during this process.

## Content

- Files are plain Markdown (`.md`) and live in folders. You’ll find high-level notes and step-by-step how-tos under folders like:
  - `General notes/`
  - `How to dos/`
  - `logic programming/` (contains `blueprints/` and `c++/` subfolders)
  - `World/` (levels, Actors, Components, UObjects)
  - `not important (images)/` (images copied from screenshots)
  - `Version control/` (git notes)

- Images are stored in the `not important (images)/` folder as PNGs. Everything you need to read and reuse the content is included — no compiled assets, no engine project files.

This means the content is frictionless to clone, edit, and publish. It’s intentionally lightweight: Markdown + images = maximum portability.

## Why this repo exists

Because learning Unreal Engine is messy. This repo keeps small, practical notes and recipes in plain Markdown so they’re easy to read, share, and evolve. It’s your portable UE brain.
